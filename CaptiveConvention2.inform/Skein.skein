You wake up in the dark and check the clock in the corner of the room. Oh my gosh! It is way past the time when you were supposed to leave. You check your sorroundings. You are in a small office in the convention center. Earlier today, you were attending a game convention when you became very tired. You found this office unlocked and took a little nap. You make your way to the entrance and try the doors. Locked. Dang. You walk back to the Main hall. I need to get out, but where do I start?
